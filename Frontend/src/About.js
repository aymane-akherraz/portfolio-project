        The inspiration for this project came from my experience with Medium.
        One day, I created a post on their platform and was captivated by the
        simplicity and elegance of their website. I admired how intuitive and user-friendly
        it was, and it sparked a desire in me to create a similar blogging platform. This project,
        which also serves as my Portfolio Project for Holberton School, is a reflection of that initial
        inspiration and my journey towards building something just as engaging and accessible.
